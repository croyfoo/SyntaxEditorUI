# Getting started

Create an editor backed by one observable model.

## Add the package

Add [SyntaxEditorUI](https://github.com/lynnswap/SyntaxEditorUI) as a Swift package dependency in Xcode, select its **SyntaxEditorUI** product for your app target, and import `SyntaxEditorUI`.

## Create a SwiftUI editor

Keep the model in `@State` so the editor retains the same document state when SwiftUI reevaluates the view.

```swift
import SwiftUI
import SyntaxEditorUI

struct EditorView: View {
    @State private var model = SyntaxEditorModel(
        text: "const answer = 42;",
        language: .javascript
    )

    var body: some View {
        SyntaxEditor(model)
            .onChange(of: model.text) {
                print("Edited text:", model.text)
            }
    }
}
```

Use ``SyntaxEditorView`` or ``SyntaxEditorViewController`` for native integration. They accept the same ``SyntaxEditorModel``.

## Own the document state

The model holds text, a UTF-16 selection range, language, editability, wrapping, and appearance. Read and update it on the main actor. Views observe it and send edits back to it.

Your app owns file access, persistence, and document identity. Read `model.text` when saving, and use `model.replaceContents(text:language:selectedRange:)` when loading text together with its language. SyntaxEditorUI does not read or write files.

`model.textRevision` advances when text changes. Changing only the selection or language does not advance it. `model.latestTextChange` describes the most recent text change; it is not a queue of every edit. See ``SyntaxEditorModel`` and ``SyntaxEditorTextChange`` for the mutation contract.

## Switch documents

Create a separate model when documents need independent state. Passing a different model to ``SyntaxEditor``, or calling `update(model:)` on a native editor, rebinds that editor and clears its undo history.

There is no explicit close operation. Remove the editor from its container and release the model when your app no longer needs the document.
